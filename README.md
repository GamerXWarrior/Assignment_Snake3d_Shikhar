My Game Link: https://gamerx-4def4.web.app/snake3d   (only PC Webgame. Control from arrow keys. Controls are nor added for mobiles.)

-- I have implemented all game's required fields. But Fruit data loading from external file can not be done. 
-- So i normally created the Streak Functionality to the fruits. I was trying to do it from JSON file, but could not do to that.

-- Basic idea of my game is that i created a tag file in which i put all the neccessary tags and enums. 
-- A player controller in which i am generating the snake and giving it speed and a fix direction of instantiation to start from. And also getting the collision from the
   walls and self body and collision of the fruits.
-- A Game controller script is created for the collision and game over and score count and high score events. In which high score is being saved to local strorage.
